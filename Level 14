For this one you need to connect to your local host from the remote host (well well well how the turntables...)

To do that, first find the password. 
Then check the man page of the nc command. The most important piece of information here, to me, at least for this level,is :
In  the  simplest usage, "nc host port" creates a TCP connection to the given port on the given target host.  Your standard input is then sent to the host, and anything that comes back across
       the connection is sent to your standard output.  This continues indefinitely, until the network side of the connection shuts down.  Note that this behavior is different from most other appli‚Äê
       cations which shut everything down and exit after an end-of-file on the standard input.

There. 
Now we have to "submit" our password to the localhost. First what you do is use nc to open a connection to localhost <port number>
Then STDIN will open, enter the password there.

To make it easier, you can use pipelining. Do echo <password> | nc... stuff. Then what happens is that it gets opened and automatically
echoes it (check man echo if you don't know it) to the localhost. Then you are given the password to level 15.

(Looks like the thing you write first is executed second - writing echo after nc doesn't work it just prints it in your terminal.)
 
 Update:
You can also check the man page of the telnet command, and you can figure out that typing in the same format (telnet host port) will bring the same results
